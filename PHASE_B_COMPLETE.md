# Phase B Implementation - Complete ✅

## Phase B.1: Add Basic Card Playing Move ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **New Move: `playCard`** (`src/game/index.js`):
   - Validates card index to prevent out-of-bounds errors
   - Only allows playing `CARD_TYPES.REGULAR` cards in Phase B
   - Moves card from player hand to discard pile
   - Does NOT end turn - allows multiple card plays
   - Extensive console logging for debugging

2. **Turn Management Update**:
   - Updated `turn.maxMoves` from 1 to 10 to allow multiple card plays
   - `turn.minMoves` remains 1 (must draw at least one card)
   - Players can now play multiple cards before drawing

3. **UI Integration** (`src/components/PlayerHand.jsx`):
   - Cards are clickable when it's the player's turn
   - Only regular cards show as playable (visual feedback)
   - Card click calls `moves.playCard(cardIndex)`
   - Proper visual feedback for playable vs non-playable cards

### Validation:
- ✅ Players can play regular cards from their hand
- ✅ Cards move from hand to discard pile correctly
- ✅ Turn doesn't end after playing a card
- ✅ Players must still draw a card to end their turn
- ✅ Invalid card indices return INVALID_MOVE
- ✅ Cannot play Defuse or Exploding Kitten cards (Phase B restriction)
- ✅ UI shows clear feedback for which cards can be played

## Phase B.2: Implement Exploding Kitten Detection ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced `drawCard` Move**:
   - Detects when an Exploding Kitten is drawn
   - Checks player's hand for Defuse cards
   - **With Defuse**: Uses defuse card, sets pending placement state
   - **Without Defuse**: Eliminates player immediately
   - Prevents exploding kitten from being added to hand if player explodes
   - Checks win condition after player elimination

2. **New Move: `placeExplodingKitten`**:
   - Allows defused exploding kitten to be placed back in deck
   - Validates position (0 = top, deck.length = bottom)
   - Clears pending state after placement
   - Only callable by player who defused the kitten

3. **Game State Enhancement**:
   - Added `pendingExplodingKitten` field for defused kittens
   - Added `pendingPlayer` field to track who needs to place
   - Maintains game state consistency

4. **Win Condition Logic** (`endIf`):
   - Game ends when only one player remains (last player standing)
   - Game ends when deck is empty (all survivors win)
   - Returns proper winner information for UI display

5. **Turn Order Management**:
   - `turn.onBegin` skips eliminated players automatically
   - Ensures game continues smoothly after eliminations

6. **UI Integration**:
   - **Exploding Kitten Placement Interface**: Modal-style interface when player needs to place
   - **Three placement options**: Top, Middle, Bottom of deck
   - **Clear visual feedback**: Red background, prominent buttons
   - **Proper state detection**: Only shows when `G.pendingExplodingKitten` and correct player

### Validation:
- ✅ Drawing Exploding Kitten with Defuse card triggers placement interface
- ✅ Drawing Exploding Kitten without Defuse card eliminates player
- ✅ Eliminated players are skipped in turn order
- ✅ Game ends when only one player remains
- ✅ Game ends when deck is exhausted
- ✅ Defuse cards are properly consumed when used
- ✅ Exploding Kitten can be placed at any position in deck
- ✅ Placement interface appears for human player
- ✅ Placement interface clears after placement

## Current Working State After Phase B

### Complete Game Flow:
1. ✅ Game initializes with 4 players and proper deck
2. ✅ Players can play regular cards from their hand (multiple cards per turn)
3. ✅ Players draw cards to end their turn
4. ✅ Exploding Kittens are detected and handled properly
5. ✅ Defuse cards work correctly (auto-consume, placement interface)
6. ✅ Players are eliminated when drawing exploding kittens without defuse
7. ✅ Turn order skips eliminated players
8. ✅ Game ends with proper winner declaration
9. ✅ UI provides complete feedback for all game states

### New Moves Available:
- ✅ `playCard(cardIndex)`: Play regular cards from hand
- ✅ `drawCard()`: Draw a card (may trigger exploding kitten)
- ✅ `placeExplodingKitten(position)`: Place defused exploding kitten

### Game State Enhancements:
- ✅ `G.discardPile`: Tracks played cards
- ✅ `G.pendingExplodingKitten`: Stores defused exploding kitten
- ✅ `G.pendingPlayer`: Tracks who needs to place exploding kitten
- ✅ `G.players[].isEliminated`: Tracks player elimination

### UI Features:
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for playable cards
- ✅ Exploding kitten placement interface
- ✅ Game over screen with winner display
- ✅ Turn indicators and game status
- ✅ Card type visual differentiation (colors, emojis)

## Testing Performed

### Basic Gameplay:
- ✅ Started game with 4 players
- ✅ Played multiple regular cards per turn
- ✅ Drew cards to end turn
- ✅ Verified card counts update correctly
- ✅ Confirmed discard pile shows played cards

### Exploding Kitten Scenarios:
- ✅ Drew exploding kitten with defuse card → placement interface appears
- ✅ Placed exploding kitten at different positions (top, middle, bottom)
- ✅ Confirmed exploding kitten returns to deck at correct position
- ✅ Verified defuse card is consumed and discarded

### Elimination Scenarios:
- ✅ Drew exploding kitten without defuse card → player eliminated
- ✅ Confirmed eliminated player skipped in turn order
- ✅ Verified game continues with remaining players
- ✅ Tested game end when only one player remains

### Edge Cases:
- ✅ Attempted to play non-regular cards → properly blocked
- ✅ Attempted invalid card indices → returns INVALID_MOVE
- ✅ Placement position validation works correctly
- ✅ Game state remains consistent throughout

## Framework Integration Notes

### boardgame.io Patterns Maintained:
- ✅ All moves use proper `({ G, playerID }, ...args)` signature
- ✅ `INVALID_MOVE` used for validation
- ✅ State mutations are direct (no immutability required)
- ✅ `endIf` provides proper game ending structure
- ✅ Turn management uses standard `onBegin` hook

### React Integration:
- ✅ Components receive standard boardgame.io props
- ✅ Move calls use `moves.moveName(args)` pattern
- ✅ State updates trigger automatic re-renders
- ✅ Game over state handled through `ctx.gameover`

### Random Number Generation:
- ✅ Uses boardgame.io's `random.Shuffle()` for deterministic gameplay
- ✅ Maintains reproducible game sessions for debugging
