# Phase 1 Implementation Plan: From Minimal Working Game to Complete Exploding Kittens

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed roadmap for building a complete Phase 1 Exploding Kittens game from the current minimal working foundation. The plan is designed for AI agent implementation with sufficient context to avoid the complexity traps and framework integration issues that were recently resolved.

**Current State**: Minimal 90-line boardgame.io implementation with single `drawCard` move working correctly
**Target State**: Complete playable Exploding Kittens game meeting all Phase 1 requirements
**Approach**: Incremental feature addition with validation at each step, maintaining framework pattern compliance

## Critical Success Principles

### 1. Framework Pattern Adherence
- **Rule**: NEVER deviate from proven boardgame.io patterns without extensive testing
- **Reference**: Always validate against official boardgame.io documentation
- **Testing**: Confirm each change works before proceeding to next feature
- **Debugging**: Maintain extensive console logging until feature is stable

### 2. Incremental Development Methodology
- **Approach**: Build one feature at a time on proven working foundation
- **Validation**: Test each feature thoroughly before adding the next
- **Rollback**: If any step breaks existing functionality, revert and reassess
- **Documentation**: Document what works and what doesn't for future reference

### 3. Avoid Complexity Traps
- **Risk**: Don't implement multiple interconnected features simultaneously
- **Mitigation**: Each task should be completable independently
- **Validation**: Ensure each step results in a working game state
- **Recovery**: Maintain ability to return to last working state at any point

## Current Working Foundation Analysis

### What's Working (DO NOT BREAK)
```javascript
// Game setup with proper boardgame.io pattern
setup: ({ ctx, random }) => {
  // Creates 2 players with 5 cards each
  // Uses random.Shuffle() for deterministic shuffling
  // Returns proper game state structure
}

// Single move with correct signature
moves: {
  drawCard: ({ G, playerID }) => {
    // Proper parameter destructuring
    // Simple deck manipulation
    // No complex validation
  }
}

// Simple turn management
turn: {
  minMoves: 1,
  maxMoves: 1  // Automatic turn advancement
}

// React Client configuration
Client({
  game: ExplodingKittensGame,
  board: GameBoard,
  debug: true
})
```

### What Needs Enhancement (INCREMENTAL ADDITIONS)
1. **Player Count**: Currently 2 players, need 4 players (1 human, 3 CPU)
2. **Card System**: Currently simple cards, need proper Exploding Kittens card types
3. **Game Mechanics**: Currently just draw, need play cards and exploding kitten mechanics
4. **Win Conditions**: Currently no end game, need elimination and victory logic
5. **AI Behavior**: Currently no CPU logic, need basic AI decision making

## Phase-by-Phase Implementation Plan

---

## Phase A: Expand Foundation (Maintain Current Working State)

### A.1: Upgrade to 4-Player Game Structure
**Objective**: Expand from 2 to 4 players while maintaining current working functionality

**Implementation Approach**:
```javascript
// In setup function, change player creation loop
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {  // Changed from ctx.numPlayers
  players[i] = {
    id: i,
    name: i === 0 ? 'You' : `CPU ${i}`,
    hand: playerHand,
    isEliminated: false,
    isCPU: i !== 0
  };
}
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] Game initializes with exactly 4 players
- [ ] Human player is Player 0 labeled "You"
- [ ] CPU players are labeled "CPU 1", "CPU 2", "CPU 3"
- [ ] Turn rotation works through all 4 players
- [ ] UI displays all players correctly
- [ ] Current `drawCard` move still functions for all players

**Framework Integration Notes**:
- Use `ctx.numPlayers` for dynamic sizing but default to 4
- Ensure Client configuration supports 4 players
- Validate turn management works with expanded player count

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] drawCard works for Player 0 (human)
- [ ] Turn advances to Player 1 (CPU)
- [ ] Turn continues through Players 2 and 3
- [ ] Turn wraps back to Player 0
- [ ] All players display in UI correctly

---

### A.2: Implement Proper Card System
**Objective**: Replace simple cards with actual Exploding Kittens card types

**Card Type Implementation**:
```javascript
// Card types to implement
const CARD_TYPES = {
  REGULAR: 'regular',
  EXPLODING_KITTEN: 'exploding_kitten',
  DEFUSE: 'defuse'
};

// Proper deck composition for Phase 1
function createPhaseDeck() {
  const deck = [];
  
  // 47 regular cards (various types for simplicity)
  for (let i = 0; i < 47; i++) {
    deck.push(createCard(`regular-${i}`, CARD_TYPES.REGULAR, `Card ${i}`));
  }
  
  // 6 defuse cards
  for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    deck.push(createCard(`defuse-${i}`, CARD_TYPES.DEFUSE, `Defuse ${i}`));
  }
  
  // 3 exploding kitten cards
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    deck.push(createCard(`exploding-${i}`, CARD_TYPES.EXPLODING_KITTEN, `Exploding Kitten ${i}`));
  }
  
  return deck;
}
```

**Initial Hand Distribution** (Following Requirements):
- Each player gets exactly 1 Defuse card
- Each player gets 7 regular cards
- Total: 8 cards per player (32 cards dealt)
- Remaining deck: 24 cards (2 Defuse + 3 Exploding Kittens + 19 regular)

**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] Deck has correct card composition (47 regular, 6 defuse, 3 exploding)
- [ ] Each player starts with exactly 1 defuse card
- [ ] Each player starts with exactly 7 regular cards
- [ ] Remaining deck has 24 cards after dealing
- [ ] Cards have proper type, id, and name properties
- [ ] Current `drawCard` move still functions with new card types

**Framework Integration Notes**:
- Use `random.Shuffle()` for proper boardgame.io random number generation
- Ensure card objects are serializable for boardgame.io state management
- Validate that complex card objects don't break existing functionality

---

## Phase B: Core Gameplay Mechanics

### B.1: Add Basic Card Playing Move
**Objective**: Implement `playCard` move to allow cards to be played from hand

**Move Implementation**:
```javascript
moves: {
  drawCard: ({ G, playerID }) => {
    // Keep existing working implementation
  },
  
  playCard: ({ G, playerID }, cardIndex) => {
    // Validate card index
    if (!G.players[playerID].hand[cardIndex]) {
      return INVALID_MOVE;
    }
    
    const card = G.players[playerID].hand[cardIndex];
    
    // Only allow regular cards for now
    if (card.type !== CARD_TYPES.REGULAR) {
      return INVALID_MOVE;
    }
    
    // Move card to discard pile
    G.players[playerID].hand.splice(cardIndex, 1);
    G.discardPile.push(card);
    
    // Don't end turn - allow multiple card plays
  }
}
```

**Turn Management Update**:
```javascript
turn: {
  minMoves: 1,    // Must draw at least one card
  maxMoves: 10    // Allow multiple card plays before drawing
}
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] Players can play regular cards from their hand
- [ ] Cards move from hand to discard pile correctly
- [ ] Turn doesn't end after playing a card
- [ ] Players must still draw a card to end their turn
- [ ] Invalid card indices return INVALID_MOVE
- [ ] Cannot play Defuse or Exploding Kitten cards yet

**UI Integration**:
- [ ] Cards in hand are clickable for current player
- [ ] playCard move is called when card is clicked
- [ ] Hand display updates when card is played
- [ ] Discard pile shows played cards

---

### B.2: Implement Exploding Kitten Detection
**Objective**: Add danger when Exploding Kitten cards are drawn

**Enhanced drawCard Move**:
```javascript
drawCard: ({ G, playerID }) => {
  if (G.deck.length === 0) {
    return INVALID_MOVE;
  }

  const card = G.deck.pop();
  
  // Check if it's an exploding kitten
  if (card.type === CARD_TYPES.EXPLODING_KITTEN) {
    // Check for defuse card
    const defuseIndex = G.players[playerID].hand.findIndex(
      c => c.type === CARD_TYPES.DEFUSE
    );
    
    if (defuseIndex !== -1) {
      // Player has defuse - remove it and set state for placement
      G.players[playerID].hand.splice(defuseIndex, 1);
      G.discardPile.push(G.players[playerID].hand[defuseIndex]);
      
      // Set state for exploding kitten placement
      G.pendingExplodingKitten = card;
      G.pendingPlayer = playerID;
      
      // Don't end turn - wait for placement
      return;
    } else {
      // Player has no defuse - eliminate them
      G.players[playerID].isEliminated = true;
      // Don't add exploding kitten to hand
    }
  } else {
    // Regular card - add to hand
    G.players[playerID].hand.push(card);
  }
  
  // Check win condition
  const alivePlayers = Object.values(G.players).filter(p => !p.isEliminated);
  if (alivePlayers.length === 1) {
    // Game over - single winner
    return;
  }
}
```

**Add Exploding Kitten Placement Move**:
```javascript
placeExplodingKitten: ({ G, playerID }, position) => {
  if (!G.pendingExplodingKitten || G.pendingPlayer !== playerID) {
    return INVALID_MOVE;
  }
  
  // Insert at specified position (0 = top, -1 = bottom)
  if (position === -1) {
    G.deck.push(G.pendingExplodingKitten);
  } else {
    G.deck.splice(position, 0, G.pendingExplodingKitten);
  }
  
  // Clear pending state
  G.pendingExplodingKitten = null;
  G.pendingPlayer = null;
}
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] Drawing Exploding Kitten with Defuse card triggers placement interface
- [ ] Drawing Exploding Kitten without Defuse card eliminates player
- [ ] Eliminated players are skipped in turn order
- [ ] Game ends when only one player remains
- [ ] Defuse cards are properly consumed when used
- [ ] Exploding Kitten can be placed at any position in deck

---

## Phase C: Complete Game Experience

### C.1: Add Win Condition Logic
**Objective**: Implement proper game ending with winner declaration

**Game End Conditions**:
```javascript
// In game definition
endIf: ({ G, ctx }) => {
  const alivePlayers = Object.values(G.players).filter(p => !p.isEliminated);
  
  if (alivePlayers.length === 1) {
    return {
      winner: alivePlayers[0].id,
      winnerName: alivePlayers[0].name,
      reason: "Last player standing"
    };
  }
  
  if (G.deck.length === 0) {
    return {
      winner: alivePlayers.map(p => p.id),
      winnerName: "All remaining players",
      reason: "Deck exhausted"
    };
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

**Turn Order Management**:
```javascript
turn: {
  minMoves: 1,
  maxMoves: 10,
  onBegin: ({ G, ctx, events }) => {
    // Skip eliminated players
    let currentPlayer = ctx.currentPlayer;
    while (G.players[currentPlayer]?.isEliminated) {
      events.endTurn();
      currentPlayer = ctx.currentPlayer;
    }
  }
}
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] Game ends when only one player remains alive
- [ ] Game ends when deck is empty with no exploding kittens
- [ ] Winner is correctly identified and displayed
- [ ] Eliminated players are skipped in turn rotation
- [ ] Game over state is properly displayed in UI

---

### C.2: Implement Basic CPU AI Logic
**Objective**: Make CPU players take automatic actions with simple decision making

**AI Move Enumeration**:
```javascript
// In game definition
ai: {
  enumerate: ({ G, ctx, playerID }) => {
    if (!G.players[playerID].isCPU) {
      return [];
    }
    
    const moves = [];
    
    // If pending exploding kitten placement
    if (G.pendingExplodingKitten && G.pendingPlayer === playerID) {
      // Place randomly in deck
      const position = Math.floor(Math.random() * (G.deck.length + 1));
      moves.push({ move: 'placeExplodingKitten', args: [position] });
      return moves;
    }
    
    // Random decision: play card or draw
    if (Math.random() > 0.5 && G.players[playerID].hand.length > 0) {
      // Try to play a random regular card
      const regularCards = G.players[playerID].hand
        .map((card, index) => ({ card, index }))
        .filter(({ card }) => card.type === CARD_TYPES.REGULAR);
      
      if (regularCards.length > 0) {
        const randomCard = regularCards[Math.floor(Math.random() * regularCards.length)];
        moves.push({ move: 'playCard', args: [randomCard.index] });
      }
    }
    
    // Always include draw option
    if (G.deck.length > 0) {
      moves.push({ move: 'drawCard', args: [] });
    }
    
    return moves;
  }
}
```

**CPU Timing and Behavior**:
- Add 1-3 second delays for CPU moves to maintain game flow
- Use simple random decision making for card play vs draw
- Automatically handle defuse usage and exploding kitten placement
- Provide visual feedback when CPU players take actions

**Validation Requirements**:
- [ ] CPU players automatically take turns within 1-3 seconds
- [ ] CPU players make reasonable decisions (play cards or draw)
- [ ] CPU players automatically use defuse cards when drawing exploding kittens
- [ ] CPU players place exploding kittens at random positions
- [ ] Game flow continues smoothly with CPU players
